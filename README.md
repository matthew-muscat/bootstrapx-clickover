Bootstrapx Clickover
=================

Bootstrapx Clickover provides enhancements to [Twitter Bootstrap Popovers](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap#popover) to allow popovers to be opened/closed with click events.

This repo is a fork of leecar-red's original Bootstrapx Clickover, however this repo will aim to keep itself always up to date with the latest stable bootstrap version. While backwards compatibilty may be possible, this repo is about moving forward - the plugin versioning will match bootstraps primary versioning syntax to indicate compatibility.

Quick Start
-----------

After including bootstrapx-clickover.js do the following:

 $('rel["clickover"]').clickover();

Requires
--------

Must include bootstrap's tooltip and popover js libraries and bootstrap's css

Currently this plugin is at version 2.2.2, which supports Bootstrap verison: 2.2.2

I have not tested with previous versions of bootstrap, however backwards compatibilty may be possible.


Version
-----------

2.2.2
